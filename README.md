# 🌳 Visual Binary Search Tree (BST) in Python

This project implements a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Python with both **console-based tree visualization**
and **graphical rendering using Graphviz**. It supports interactive insertion and search operations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Binary Search Tree (BST) with basic insertion and search
- 📦 Node-based structure with recursive algorithms
- 🖼 Visual rendering of the tree using [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
- 📄 Text-based pretty-printing of the tree in terminal
- 🎮 Interactive CLI for inserting and searching nodes

---

## 📸 Preview

After inserting nodes, a tree image (`bst_tree.png`) is automatically generated and opened:

## 🧩 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `graphviz` system package (for rendering)
- `graphviz` Python module

### Install system Graphviz:

**macOS** (Homebrew):

```bash
brew install graphviz
```

### Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

**Windows**
Download from: https://graphviz.org/download/

### Install Python package:

```bash
pip3 install graphviz
```

### 💻 How to Run

```bash
python3 binarySearchTree.py
```

#### Then follow the CLI prompts to:

- Insert values into the BST

- Search for values

- Quit the program

### 📚 Files

- binarySearchTree.py — Main script with all logic

- bst_tree.png — Auto-generated visual of the BST (updated on each insertion)

### 🧠 Concepts Used

- Binary Search Tree structure

- Recursion

- Class-based design

- Visualization with Graphviz

### 🙌 Future Improvements

- ❎ Duplicate value prevention (currently ignored)

- 🔁 Delete nodes

- 📏 AVL Tree (self-balancing)
